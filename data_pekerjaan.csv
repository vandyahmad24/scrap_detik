The MIT Digital Currency Initiative is looking for a software engineer (remote-friendly) to help build the future of money. Our existing financial system is slow, expensive, and deeply unfair. We need a new financial system that serves everyone instead of just wealthy institutions, and digital cash could be its base layer. This new role will work with research scientists and developers at the DCI to design and implement open source software for a retail central bank digital currency, collaborating closely with a team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

Working at MIT, this is a chance to help build the money of the future. We're looking for a software engineer who can work with students, developers, and researchers to bring cash into the internet era.

You should have:

Systems or security programming experience (preferably C/C++, Go, or Rust)

Passion for designing the next iteration of digital money

Interest in collaborating with students and researchers

A strong desire to contribute to open source software projects

Ability and interest in communicating with non-technical stakeholders

Desire to work independently and drive process, like creating a plan to distill requirements in order to implement and evaluate systems with different trade-offs

Willingness to help create an inclusive environment for people of all backgrounds

Responsibilities:

In collaboration with others at the DCI and the team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, work as part of a team to architect and design a secure, high-throughput, resilient digital cash transaction system

Lead technical implementation of such a system

Operate effectively in an independent environment where requirements are not necessarily well-specified

Contribute to creating an inclusive environment where people of all races, genders, ages, and other backgrounds are empowered to do their best work and receive recognition for it

MIT DCI and the Media Lab:

The Media Lab is a research organization within MIT without traditional disciplinary constraints. It is scientists, engineers, artists, and designers who strive to create technologies and experiences that enable people to understand and transform their lives, communities, and environments.

The DCI is a team of researchers and developers building cryptocurrency and blockchain technology software. Our mission is to empower people by making it as easy to move value as it is to move information.

We have been one of the leading institutions building Bitcoin software since our founding in 2015, and we have been thinking about central bank digital currency since 2016.

We contribute to and participate in the open source cryptocurrency community via talks, software, code review, and published papers. All our work is open-source.

We welcome remote or non-remote applicants. Our team is currently 100% remote, and during non-pandemic times, closer to 50%. Our office is in the Media Lab on MIT’s campus in Cambridge, MA. We can provide pay that is competitive for university developer and researcher roles, and whether this is part-time or full-time is negotiable. International workers are welcome to apply as long as working hours overlap at least 3 hours with 9 AM - 6 PM EST. We cannot sponsor visas.

If this is exciting to you, please reach out with your CV or résumé. We anticipate a start date in Fall 2020.    ","

Rehab2Fit Technologies, Inc. is a well funded, early-stage, direct-to-consumer technology company that is bringing to market a revolutionary, state-of-the-art, artificial intelligence guided set of products for at-home musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and neurological rehabilitation for the over 55 demographic. Similar to Peloton, we are designing interactive, experiential products and services but geared for seniors going from rehab to fitness. See our product demo at: http://www.rehab2fit.com/video

We are seeking one special Android developer to round off our software startup team who meets the following criteria:

- 3-5 years of Android development experience
- Skilled with the MVVM pattern for Android
- Experience with a Scrum environment
- Experience with SVN or Git
- 3+ years of experience working remotely from home
- 5+ years experience working in an aggressive startup mode environment

Here’s what we're offering:

- This is a work from home opportunity
- Salary $125 K TO $150K based on current relevant experience
- Incentive bonuses based on performance
- Equity/stock in the company, with significant upside potential
- Other company benefits equivalent to early-stage startups
- Since you’ve worked in startups, you know the kind of intensity and excitement that comes with the territory. What you may not know is what it’s like to be in a company that has explosive growth potential and its potential rewards. The right person will thrive in this environment, and the wrong person will be overrun by the intensity.

About me:

My name is Michael Bissonnette, and I am a serial entrepreneur that has founded and built four sizable international consumer companies. I’ve taken my last two companies public on NASDAQ, including my most recent company AeroGrow International.

For the last four years, I have been the President and Board member of a high-tech medical rehab company, ROM Technologies ( http://www.romtech.com ), helping them raise $50 million and bringing an extraordinary, new medical product to the market.

As a seasoned marketer, I saw the huge potential of using this same technology to develop a lower-cost product with more customized features tailored for the consumer market.

With the approval and financing from ROM Tech, I founded a spinoff, Rehab2Fit Technologies, Inc. Subsequently, we have filed for 13 patents on our one-of-a-kind, consumer rehab/medical products, built prototypes and are currently working towards our alpha product launch in early January, 2021.

My intention is to take Rehab2Fit public, as I have done with my last two companies. Should this occur, and if you’re the right fit for this job, this opportunity may very well be the most lucrative and exciting job you have ever had.

If you feel inspired and qualified to join us, respond by including:

- A personalized cover letter detailing why you might be the ideal candidate for this job.
- An up-to-date resume, along with your LinkedIn profile if you have one.
- A few examples of product(s) you have worked on that reflect your software development skills and accomplishments.

Finally, openness, honesty, and candidness are qualities I respond to—as opposed to framing things in the right way with the right words. Please just be yourself.

Respectfully,

Michael Bissonnette
CEO Rehab2Fit Technologies Inc.    ","
